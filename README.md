<h1>GNSS Noise Analysis based on Kalman Filter</h1>
<p>This program is a noise analysis tool based on the Kalman filter.  
  The approach primarily follows Didova et al. (2016), which incorporates the ARMA process to model colored noise in GNSS time series.  
  In this simplified example, only the AR(p) process is supported.</p>
